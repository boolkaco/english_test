A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. It includes basic setup, dependencies, and a ready-to-code environment for both Android and iOS platforms.

### Installation

Before you run the application, you need to fetch all the necessary dependencies. In the root directory of your project, execute the following command:

```bash  
flutter pub get
```

This command retrieves all the required Flutter dependencies and ensures that your project is ready to build and run.

### iOS Setup

If you're developing for iOS, you might need to update and install CocoaPods dependencies to ensure the latest versions of the iOS project dependencies are correctly configured. Navigate to the `ios` directory within your Flutter project and run:

```bash
cd ios
pod repo update
pod install
```

This step updates your local CocoaPods repository and installs the dependencies specified in your `Podfile`.
